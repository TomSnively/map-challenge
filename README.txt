Display five geography items (countries, cities, US states, body of water and a misc item) for someone to find in 60 seconds.

My son is really loving geography, so we bought a large (69.25" x 48x) poster World Map:

Now I want us to play a game I played in sixth grade: Map Challenge.

You get 5 geographical items. In my case, they will be:

[1]    Country
[1]    City
[1]    US State
[1]    Body of water (Ocean / Sea / River / Lake / Bay)
[1]    Other: (Continent / Mountain range / Desert / lines [equator, tropic of cancer, etc.])

We'll run this on his iPad. After you see the items, there is a 60-second clock. Each of the items is a button that you have to touch when you have found it on the map.

If the clock runs down, I may implement hints. For example, it might say "Armenia is in Europe."

I will read this file from a JSON file that contains all the data.

To do list:

[x] Create JSON data file
[x] Read the fie
[x] Turn it into usable data
[x] Choose five random items
[x] Make the five buttons
[x] Implement the clock
[x] disable the buttons when clock runs out
[x] add a restart button
[x] better label for the clock
[ ] Try adding hints when time is running low
[ ] Add "beeps" or other sound effects to let someone know of a hint (or when clock runs low)
